# first_nft_mint

This project is part of [\_buildspace's](https://buildspace.so/) **Mint Your Own NFT experience**.

A smart contract is deployed that generates 
an NFT with a raondom combination of words from a pre-selected word bank.<br>
The background color is randomly generated as well.

Users can visit this [website](https://nft-starter-repo-final.ando-woods.repl.co/)
to connect their Ethereum wallet, 
and mint an NFT to their own wallet.<br>
They will also be able to re-sell the NFT on OpenSea!<br>
